## Completion Notes

- Root CLI uses `add_completion=False`; keep `completion_init()` in `src/app/cli.py`.
- Typer completion scripts use `complete_bash` / `complete_zsh` style instructions.
- Without Typer's completion classes registered at startup, runtime completion can emit `plain,xxx` values or reject the shell instruction.
- Do not reintroduce hand-written static command lists for bash/zsh/fish; generate scripts from the Typer/Click command tree.

## Speaker Preview Notes

- IINA may ignore CLI-provided `--mpv-sub-file` for external subtitles.
- Its mpv log showed only `Loading external files in .../source/` and no open of `exports/subtitle.srt`.
- For IINA preview, stage a same-stem `.srt` next to the source video so IINA/mpv auto-loads it as a sidecar subtitle.

## Speaker Apply Notes

- `meeting-asr project speakers apply --map N=Name` is a patch operation by default. It must merge into saved speaker names instead of replacing `speaker_map.json`.
- Destructive replacement requires the explicit `--replace` flag.
- When merging, preserve `speaker_person_map.json` entries only for unchanged names. If a speaker name changes without a new person id, drop that speaker's stale voiceprint link.

## ASR Postprocess Notes

- Filler-only speaker removal happens in `src/app/postprocess.py` during `parse_transcription_result()`.
- It only affects newly normalized ASR output. Existing project artifacts keep old `asr/sentences.json` and `project.json` speaker IDs until reprocessed from `asr/raw_result.json` or retranscribed.
- Backchannel-heavy tracks can contain short fragments like `对对对` or `就是可以再理一下了`; treat them as low-information tracks instead of requiring every sentence to match the exact filler word list.
- A real attendee may appear only as short backchannel utterances. Before declaring that a person is absent after rerun, compare `asr/raw_result.json` speaker IDs against normalized `asr/sentences.json`; `load_transcript_result()` and `project show` can still hide a raw speaker through the low-information filter.

## Project TUI Notes

- `src/app/commands/project.py` is already oversized; do not put Textual UI implementations there.
- Keep project selection/review UI modules separate, such as `src/app/project_tui.py` and `src/app/speaker_tui.py`, and leave command modules as thin Typer adapters.
- Project Review inline text correction mutates in-memory `SentenceSegment.text` before final save. Keep a separate loaded-text baseline for correction diffs; otherwise re-editing a staged sentence compares version 2 -> version 3 instead of original -> version 3.
- Terminal IME composition may not reach Textual text widgets even though bracketed paste works. Keep paste-friendly editing and an external-editor fallback for Chinese correction text.

## Project Identity Notes

- Do not build new project identity from creation date or title. That created duplicate projects for the same video and made IDs change across runs.
- Project IDs are content-based (`p-<sha16>`) and default project directories use the same string. `project create` / `project run` must reuse an existing project for the same source video even when an explicit `--project-dir` is provided; `--project-dir` is only the desired path for a brand-new source.
- For deliberate same-source experiments, use `--variant <name>` so the project id becomes `p-<sha16>-v-<name>`. Do not create multiple directories with the same `project_id` to compare ASR settings.
- `project_id` is the only project identity printed by `project list` and generated next-step commands. Do not add numeric project list shortcuts back.

## Install And Verification Notes

- Agent-side development and verification must run through `uv run ...` in the current checkout or worktree. Do not use the global `meeting-asr` binary to validate code you just edited.
- User-facing validation on the main checkout should use the global editable tool installed by `scripts/install-tool.sh`.
- Before claiming a checkout is active in the global `meeting-asr`, verify `which meeting-asr`, imported `app.__file__`, and `meeting_asr-*.dist-info/direct_url.json`.
- `direct_url.json` without `{"editable": true}` means the global command imports a packaged wheel snapshot, not live checkout code.
- If working from a temporary worktree, do not repoint the global editable install to that worktree unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- `scripts/install-tool.sh` defaults to editable mode for local development. `scripts/install-tool.sh --wheel` is only for release or formal user-install simulation.
- Historical memory entries that mention raw `uv tool install --editable . --force` are stale. Use `scripts/install-tool.sh`; only pass `--force` for executable conflicts.
- Local voiceprint embedding uses `local-speechbrain` as the default provider. SpeechBrain, torch, and torchaudio are standard dependencies, not a `local-voiceprint` extra; do not suggest `uv sync --extra local-voiceprint`.

## File Copy Notes

- Do not validate destructive project workflows on `rsync --link-dest` or other hardlink-based copies. Project outputs are rewritten in place during ASR, and hardlinked test copies can mutate the user's real project artifacts.
- If a non-destructive validation copy is needed, use a plain copy for writable metadata/output files (`project.json`, `asr/`, `exports/`, `speakers/`) and only link immutable large media (`source/`, `audio/`) when the command will not rewrite them.
